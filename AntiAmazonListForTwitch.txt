! Title: ðŸ“­ Anti-Amazon List for Twitch
! Version: 05May2019v1-Beta
! Expires: 7 days
! Description: Are you tired of having to look at all the buttons and links with which Amazon promote their account and payment services while you're watching a good stream (i.e. Vinesauce)? Now you won't have look at all those buttons anymore!
! Motivation: As someone who lives in Norway, which is not an Amazon core country, I became increasingly annoyed at how they hid away shipping fees from me, and even more annoyed when they barred third-party sellers from shipping abroad. Thus I deleted my Amazon account in protest, and to this day I refuse to make a new one.
! To remove non-Amazon annoyances and to make better use of the chat space, check out "Twitch: Pure Viewing Experience" (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/TwitchPureViewingExperience.txt).
