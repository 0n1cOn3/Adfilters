# Title: ðŸ’Š Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List (for Privoxy)
# Version: 21October2021v2-Alpha
# Expires: 5 days
# Description: This list goes the extra kilometer to prevent more malware than other mainstream anti-malware lists. It blocks heavily abused top-level domains (and even search engine results for them), blocks domains used in malware redirection trains and in domain parking schemes, blocks sponsored Windows PUP nags on PC guide articles, uses mass blocking of domains belonging to bad IPs, and has many other subcategories that give it a solid advantage over similar lists out there.

# â€”â€”â€” Bad top-level domains â€”â€”â€”
# You can expect these domains to have an overwhelming majority of malware domains that have nothing to do with the countries in question. Nevertheless, if you are in a situation where you have to do active business in any of the countries in question, then this list may not be ideal for you.
# Tokelau

# Gabon

# Mali

# Equatorial Guinea

# Central African Republic

# Palau

# International topical domains that have consistently horrendous scores on watchlists of bad TLDs, and whose use for legit purposes is practically non-existent.
