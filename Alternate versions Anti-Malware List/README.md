If you're looking for the uBlock Origin version, which is also the most frequently updated version, go to https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Dandelion%20Sprout's%20Anti-Malware%20List.txt instead.

The same link is also where new entries to these lists have to be added, if you're making a pull request.
