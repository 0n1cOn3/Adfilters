<b>Dandelion Sprout's Redirector Assistant List</b> is a way to redirect less-than-optimal URLs, into optimal URLs, thus making life a little easier for its users.

At the moment, the list is by default able to:
1) Turn 32-bit installation links to major Windows programs to 64-bit ones.
2) Redirect Adobe's official download links to their hidden clean download link, to avoid catching the disease known as McAfee.
3) Allow you to visit Disney's American websites from abroad.
4) Turn mobile Wikipedia links (e.g. en.m.wikipedia.org) into desktop Wikipedia links.
5) Change Google links that have an English language tag to them, into language-neutral links.
6) Change Twitter's _jpg:large_-pseudoformatted images to standard JPG ones.
7) Make R-18 Pixiv images slightly less blurry if you're not logged on.
8) Redirect Google Play's app store's frontpage to its non-game category.
9) Make it so that Reddit's 2018 GUI is used whenever possible, instead of their mid-2010's GUI.
10) Shorten Google search result URLs, to make them easier to link to.
11) Redirect the pages for a paid version of one particular Windows 10 app to its equivalent but free version.

These things are also included in the list, but must be turned on manually:
1) Make it so that YouTube's and Reddit's mid-2010's GUIs are used whenever possible, instead of their GUIs anno 2018.
2) Edit Pixiv's search conditions, so that Latin tags are not case-sensitive and thus give more search results.
3) One showcase of silly YouTube video replacement fun.

It's also possible to redirect regular webpage links into .onion pages (e.g. for Facebook and DuckDuckGo), although those entries have now been spun off into a separate list, called <b>Tor Redirector List</b>.

The lists have been successfully tested with [Redirector](http://einaregilsson.com/redirector/) on Chrome and Basilisk. They have also been tested with at least two other extensions, which it did not work with.

To download the main list file in a usable capacity, right-click [on the link to the JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/Dandelion%20Sprout-s%20Redirector%20Assistant%20List/DandelionSproutRedirectorList.json), and save it as a JSON file.

If you were to not fancy some of the entries in the lists, you can of course delete or disable them individually in Redirector's settings.

If you have any requests, wishes or problems with this lists, or just want to say hi to me, feel free to tell me about it.
