<b>Dandelion Sprout's Redirector Assistant List</b> is a way to redirect less-than-optimal URLs, into optimal URLs, thus making life a little easier for its users.

At the moment, the list will:
1) Turn 32-bit installation links to major Windows programs to 64-bit ones.
2) Redirect Adobe's own download links to those of FileHorse's, to prevent your PC from catching the disease known as McAfee.
3) Allow you to visit Disney's American websites from abroad.
4) Turn mobile Wikipedia links (e.g. en.m.wikipedia.org) into desktop Wikipedia links.
5) Change Google links that have an English language tags to them, into language-neutral links.
6) Changes Twitter's _jpg:large_-pseudoformatted images to standard JPG ones.

The list has been successfully tested with http://einaregilsson.com/redirector/ on Chrome. It should on paper also work with various other redirector extensions, but only if they have a file import function.

To "download" the list file in a usable capacity, mark all the text in [the JSON file](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Dandelion%20Sprout-s%20Redirector%20Assistant%20List/DandelionSproutRedirectorList.json), copy it into a local text editor, and save it as a JSON file.

If you have any requests, wishes or problems with this list, or just want to say hi to me, feel free to tell me about it.
