! Title: ðŸ¦¸ Dandelion Sprout's Anti-'Cartoon Hipster' List
! Version: 03October2019v2-Compilation
! Expires: 3 days
! Description: This is a uBO compilation list for those who've grown very tired of how online cartoon fans and communities generally agree on sharing the same opinions on which shows to either praise as the second coming of Winston Churchill, or hate so much as to send death threats to the creators of them. If you like actually good cartoons (e.g. the comedic, preschool, and/or European ones), here's a list for you.
