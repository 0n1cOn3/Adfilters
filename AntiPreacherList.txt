! Title:  Anti-'Insane religious preachers' List
! Version: 28June2019v2-Alpha
! Expires: 7 days
! Description: This is a dual-compatibility list for domains-list tools and uBlock Origin, which intends to target and prevent access to groups and individuals that preach things that are either very strange, very hateful, or that promote economical scams.
! For more information, details, helpful tools, and other lists that I've made, visit https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/General-info.md#english

# Nomination notes:
# Preachers from all religions, denominations, countries and languages can be nominated for this list, be it ones that are Christian, Islamic, Jewish, Buddhist, Hinduist, Shinto, Pagan, Confusianist, Sikh, cultist, you name it.
# Common examples of reasons for inclusion: If they reject science, preach that specified groups of people will go to hell based on religious scripture, serious attempts at making civil law subordinated to religious scripture, asking for non-charitable donations in exchange for favours from a god, organise hate campaigns against non-members offline or online, promoting persecution or social rejection of apostates, selling bleach for personal consumption or baths, or who actively deny (wo)men the right to participate in hobbies due to religious scripture. Among other similar reasons.
# The following exceptions apply: New Age preachers may only be included if their teachings are actively dangerous to human health, and atheist/humanist preachers may only be included if they actively organise harassment/violence campaigns against non-preaching non-atheists.
# I also make separate lists for adblockers that target elements on non-religion-specific sites that promote astrology or prayer times.
