! Description: Much like there's now lists for AdGuard Home and Pi-hole to block ads on smart-TVs, here's an attempt from me at doing the same for videogame consoles with AdGuard Home. Enjoy.
! Important note: To block ads in the consoles' dedicated internet browsers with AdGuard Home, and not in the system menus, check out https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/AdGuard%20Home%20Compilation%20List/AdGuardHomeCompilationList.txt instead.
! For more information, details, helpful tools, and other lists that I've made, visit https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/General-info.md#english
