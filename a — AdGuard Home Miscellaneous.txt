! Title: 🏘 Semi-public stuff for Dandelion Sprout's Official DNS Server
! Version: 29June2021v1
! Homepage: https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/General-info.md#english
! Description: Spun off from a.txt when I began placing public scrutiny on myself and my DNS server, as I didn't intend for some of the entries in it to be blocked by DNS server users that weren't myself, and I didn't except even hardcore tech experts to know that "$document" meant that the entries didn't apply to the server.
