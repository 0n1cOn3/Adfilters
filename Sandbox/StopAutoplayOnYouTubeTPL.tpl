# Version: 21May2019v2-Sandbox
# Description: Are you tired of having to turn off autoplay on YouTube every time you e.g. go to incognito mode? Do you work in classrooms/courserooms and don't want to accidentally show unfitting videos to your students/coursetakers? Are you worried of having to use specific extensions just for that purpose? Then this list is for you.
