After 1¬Ω years of trial setups and tinkering until March 2021, I now offer my DNS server to be used by the public! That being said, there are a considerable number of drawbacks with it that means that it should ***NOT*** be used in setups where uptime, privacy, or impartiality is important. By using this server, you agree to at least having *read* and being aware of all the info written below.

### DNS IP addresses

The main connection addresses are:
* DNS-over-HTTPS: `https://dandelionsprout.asuscomm.com:2501/dns-query`
* DNS-over-TLS: `tls://dandelionsprout.asuscomm.com:853` (There are currently problems with getting DoT to work in <i>AdGuard for Android</i>. <i>Nebulo</i> and <i>AdGuard for Windows</i> are reported to work.)
* DNS-over-QUIC: `quic://dandelionsprout.asuscomm.com:48582`
* DNSCrypt IPv4: `sdns://AQEAAAAAAAAAEjQ2LjkuMjIwLjI0NTo1NjQwNCDsdKplWV-GlLOA-lEBpZ11QS381gnDyqpTXz5sSwTaeSwyLmRuc2NyeXB0LWNlcnQuZGFuZGVsaW9uc3Byb3V0LmFzdXNjb21tLmNvbQ` (The stamp depends on the [current IPv4 address](https://www.ntppool.org/a/DandelionSprout). If the stamp seems to be dead, go to https://dnscrypt.info/stamps/ and choose the following settings: *current IPv4 address*:56404 - ec74aa65595f8694b380fa5101a59d75412dfcd609c3caaa535f3e6c4b04da79 - 2.dnscrypt-cert.dandelionsprout.asuscomm.com)

Although I do also offer standard IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, they change fairly frequently due to ASUS routers bizarrely insisting on getting a new IPv4 address each time most of its settings are changed in any way; the newest ones are usually available at https://www.ntppool.org/a/DandelionSprout.

The encrypted addresses may also go down during rare Raspberry Pi restarts, or if ASUS' lookup servers for Asuscomm are acting wonky.

### What is being blocked

The server attempts to block ads, malware, fake webshops, push notifications, and TV- and gaming-interface ads, with considerably better blocking of those than what AdGuard DNS offers. It also offers partial support for Wiimmfi online gaming, such as *Pok√©mon Pearl Version*, and *42 All-Time Classics*.

On the other hand, it goes easy on trackers, and blocks things I really don't like, such as rightwing tabloids (Daily Mail, Breitbart, 4chan), near-entire top-level domains (.tk, .top), scat, websites specifically dedicated to unfairly popular media (Azur Lane, Friendship is Magic), Scientology, a fair few US Evangelist hate preachers, and Twitch's "Prime Loot Reminder" plugin.

Current list set as of 28th of October 2021:

Are you curious about **which** exact list that is blocking a site, without having to do extensive searching? Load [this configuration file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/Wiki/Dandelion%20Sprout's%20Official%20DNS%20Server's%20quick-lookup%20uBO%20config%204th%20of%20November%202021.txt) into uBlock Origin in a secondary web browser, try to visit a site, and see which list is shown as having the entry.

### Who can use the server

Users from PR-China will not have their queries processed by the server, due to considerable amounts of query spam from that country, some of which even came from residential networks.

Additionally, company networks from The Netherlands, Romania, Russia and Ukraine will usually be prohibited as well. Residential networks from those countries are fine.

Many companies known to look through the fingers with port-scanners and spammers, are also prohibited. Full list: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/AdGuardHomeDisallowedIPs.txt

### Other technical aspects

The server runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 8GB, with Fedora Workstation aarch64 (ARM64).

The AdGuard Home update channel in use is the Beta channel (As opposed to Stable or Nightly).

Average uptime is more than 23h55min per day, but is not close enough to 24h00min00sec to be suited for life-or-death scenarios.

### Known problems

* Many (but not all) redirection/affiliation links on e.g. price comparison sites, may be blocked too. This is a known problem inherent to all major DNS adblocker servers, incl. AdGuard DNS.
* <i>Grayware Blocklist</i> blocks TLDs that aren't 100.0% malware, most notably `||club^`. Problems with specific `.club` sites are therefore extra important for me to be told about.

### Privacy

Since the server is based on AdGuard Home, the user's IP addresses and the domains they query, are stored on the server, and I reserve the right to browse through the queries if I feel bored for some reason. Additionally, the query log will occasionally help improve the lists that are used ([Example](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/commit/cd222a03bf37ee133604008227238bc52d5932b2#diff-4f9e07c6df3e782fd76b51a2dcbe332049dcc066bad61fa0997b737dfe62e22a)), and to determine the (hopefully) least interruptive times to run updates for AdGuard Home or apt-get.

No query or IP data are shared or sold to third-parties, especially so because I dislike user data buyers, and because Linux does not support OneDrive.

Current non-LAN upstreams as of 4th of November 2021:

* `quic://dns-unfiltered.adguard.com`
* `https://dns.google/dns-query`
* `tls://unicast.censurfridns.dk`

The DNS server has one server-PC and location, in Norway. This (most likely) makes the server more suited for European users than for users elsewhere.

This README is licenced under [the Dandelicence](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

Contacting me about the server, should be done at https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/issues

### Outage log (Oldest first)

* 21st of June 2021 20:15-22:29 UTC: What was planned as a 5min outage to set up a 2.5Gb Ethernet card, escalated when it turned out my soon-to-be-discarded Raspbian installation had *the entire network settings menu* disappear permanently, leading to huge problems assigning a static LAN IP to it.
* Intermittently from 24th to 26th of June 2021: In relation to upgrading to an ARM64 distro, there were problems with *firewalld* and a seemingly dead Ethernet overvoltage protector (APC PNET1GB) that led to frequent downtimes of a few minutes every few hours.
* 12th of July 2021 00:01-01:35 UTC: The AdGuard Home installation was stuck at a "The DNS server is starting" error screen, until I noticed the error by pure coincidence and powercycled the RaspPi.
* 18th of July 2021 17:51-19:10 UTC: My ASUS router's TrendMicro anti-botnet function had a total meltdown. Moreover, attempting to grab the chance to run a Fedora dnf update, took much longer than expected.
* 19th of July 2021 16:??-20:40 UTC: Near-total server failure in general. Shoutout to https://community.home-assistant.io/t/home-assistant-community-add-on-adguard-home/90684/13 for a fix that returned the server to basic functionality; alongside other network fixes and AGH settings tinkering.
* 23rd of July 21:30~22:50 UTC: I decided to try to set up DNSCrypt, which took several attempts.
* 23rd of August 20:45~21:40 UTC: Had to look into https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/3465#issuecomment-904153260
* 7th of September 01:01-01:30 UTC: One of my two Ethernet switches began bugging out for unknown reasons.
* 9th of September 20:15~23:30 UTC, and intermittently on 10th of September: Replaced my old ASUS RT-AC68U, with an ASUS RT-AX89X.
* 22th of October 09:08-09:14 UTC: What seemed like a Special K flake, had managed to cram its way into the fan of my 400‚Ç¨ network switch, and I had to get it out with an *Anna & Clara* butter knife without destroying the switch.
* 25th of October 14:00~15:45 UTC: I swear to Queen Clarion that the RaspPi just randomly froze with no input, while I was sitting in the couch playing New Super Mario Bros. 2. I need to look into *some* sort of failover server in the near future.
