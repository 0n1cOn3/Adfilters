! Title: ðŸŽ™ Rickroll Link Identifier
! Version: 21May2019v1-Alpha
! Expires: 10 days
! Description: So you're browsing Reddit or Twitch, and you're seeing an interesting info link? Wellâ€¦ about that linkâ€¦ this list will turn links to the biggest YouTube uploads of Rick Astley's Â«Never Gonna Give You UpÂ» into a bright red colour, thus helping you steer clear of being rickrolled.
! Never in my entire life have I seen anyone try to link to e.g. the Spotify uploads of Â«Never Gonna Give You UpÂ» for rickrolling, so I'll skip adding entries for streaming service links for now.
