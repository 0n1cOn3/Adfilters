# Okay, so here's how this list works. This is a categorised list of URLs that clot up Google search results.
# The list is designed for use with "Personal Blocklist" (and its Import function) for Google Search and Google Chrome users, in such a way that it removes search results for the URLs from your Google searches.
# If any other URL-based search-result-blockers for other search engines (incl. for Google Image Search) and browsers exist out there, feel free to tell me about them.
# The list is very subjective, so quite a few of you may not want to block the results for _all_ of these URLs. In that case, simply pick whichever ones from this buffet that you want to block, and paste them into Personal Blocklist.
# While this list is technically possible to add to adblocker tools, it'd be a very bad idea to do so, since you wouldn't have any control over which URLs you'll be able to block outright or not.
