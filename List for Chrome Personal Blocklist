# Okay, so here's how this list works. This is a categorised list of URLs that clot up Google search results.
# The list is designed for use with a userscript by the name of «Google Hit Hider by Domain» (and its Import function), in such a way that it removes search results for the URLs from your web searches.
# The list is very subjective, so quite a few of you may not want to block the results for _all_ of these URLs. In that case, simply pick whichever ones from this buffet that you want to block, and paste them into Google Hit Hider by Domain.
# While this list is technically possible to add to adblocker tools, it'd be a very bad idea to do so, since you wouldn't have any control over which URLs you'll be able to block outright or not.
# Repeat after me: This is NOT a «hosts» file. This is a list intended for use with a very specific browser extension that is not an adblocker.
