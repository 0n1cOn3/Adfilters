! Description: This list has been discontinued, and its content split up between two other lists of mine, the links of which are in the raw file.

! IMPORTANT NOTICE TO USERS OF THIS LIST!

! This list has been discontinued, as it was perceived to contain two categories that were too different from one another; and it'll be deleted inside of a week. I also felt like aiding the development of one or two of my other lists, as they hadn't seen much work in a while.
