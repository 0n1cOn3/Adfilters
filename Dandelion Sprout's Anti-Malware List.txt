! Title: ðŸ’Š Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List
! Version: 02April2019v1-Beta
! Expires: 5 days
! Description: Most anti-malware lists are pretty big and can cover a 5- or 6-digit amount of specific domains. But my list hereby claims to remove more than 25% of all known malware sites with just a 2-digit amount of entries. This is mostly done by blocking top-level domains that have become devastatingly abused by spammers, usually because they allowed for free and uncontrolled domain registrations. There's also additional categories that cover unusual malware and phishing domains that no other lists seem to cover.
! For more information, details, helpful tools, and other lists that I've made, visit https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/General-info.md#english

! Country domains
! You can expect these domains to have an overwhelming majority of malware domains that have nothing to do with the countries in question. Nevertheless, if you are in a situation where you have to do active business in any of the countries in question, then this list may not be ideal for you.
! Tokelau
||.tk^$domain=~coolcmd.tk|~budterence.tk|~google.tk
! Gabon
||.ga^$domain=~google.ga|~filtri-dns.ga
! Mali
||.ml^$domain=~google.ml
! Equatorial Guinea
||.gq^
! Central African Republic
||.cf^$domain=~1hos.cf|~google.cf

! Topical domains
! These are topical domains that have consistently horrendous scores on watchlists of bad TLDs, and whose use for legit purposes is practically non-existent.
! Presumably fake loans
||.loan^

! Attempted removal of Google search result entries that lead to the above top-level domains (Advanced adblockers only)
google.*##.rc:has(a[href*=".tk/"]:not([href*="coolcmd.tk"]):not([href*="budterence.tk"]):not([href*="google.tk"]))
google.*##.rc:has(a[href*=".ga/"]:not([href*="google.ga"]):not([href*="filtri-dns.ga"]))
google.*##.rc:has(a[href*=".ml/"]:not([href*="google.ml"]))
google.*##.rc:has(a[href*=".gq/"])
google.*##.rc:has(a[href*=".cf/"]:not([href*="1hos.cf"]):not([href*="google.cf"]))
google.*##.rc:has(a[href*=".loan/"])

! Dead domains that used to host lists for adblockers or "hosts" tools, but which are now either used by malware pushers, or could potentially be snapped up by them.
||adblock.gjtech.net^
||spam404bl.com^
||hufilter.hu^
||fredfiber.no^
||startshop.no^
||securemecca.com^

! Old tech-related domains that have fallen into the hands of questionable new owners.
! To log in to TP-Link routers, use tplinkwifi.net instead.
||tplinklogin.net^
||tplinkextender.net^
||ublock.org^

! IQ test sites that make you waste heaps of time by taking the test, and then try to charge you to see the results.
||funeducation.com^
||iq-research.info^
||iq-test-online.org^
||iq-test.co.uk^
||iqtest.co.uk^
||iqtest.com^
||iqtestnow.org^
||iqtestonline24.com^
||test-iq.org^
||officialiqtests.com^

! Old Linux-related domains that have been snapped up for ads, adware, and/or malware.
! How these links still remain in Unetbootin, is anyone's guess.
