We've all heard so much, or rather been shouted at so much, about that adblockers are only meant to block ads. I can confirm that that claim is wrong.

So, in order to prove the point about adblockers' non-evil versatility even further than what many others have done before me, why not make a list that removes something completely different and innocuous entirely?

To that end, I am introducing <b>Staying On The Phone Browser</b>. The purpose is simple: It aims to remove "Download the something-something app" banners that show up on various websites, when they are browsed through on mobile browsers. This helps make the reading experience cleaner <i>for those who really love their phone browsers anyway</i>. It has a clearly specified target audience, and removes something that is not controversial (that I know of).

The list is designed with Android in mind, and is chiefly tested on uBlock Origin for Fennec F-Droid. However, the list will also have some effect on other browsers (e.g. Adblock Browser) and other portable units (e.g. iOS) as well.
