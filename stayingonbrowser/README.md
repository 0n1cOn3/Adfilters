We've all heard so much, or rather been shouted at so much, about that adblockers are only meant to block ads. I can confirm that that claim is wrong.

So, in order to prove the point about adblockers' non-evil versatility even further than what many others have done before me, why not make a list that removes something completely different and innocuous entirely?

To that end, I am introducing <b>Staying On The Phone Browser</b>. The purpose is simple: It aims to remove "Download the something-something app" banners that show up on various websites, when they are browsed through on mobile browsers. This helps make the reading experience cleaner <i>for those who really love their phone browsers anyway</i>. It has a clearly specified target audience, and removes something that is not controversial (that I know of).

The list is designed with Android in mind, and is chiefly tested on uBlock Origin for Firefox Android Beta. However, the list will also have some effect on other browsers (e.g. Adblock Browser) and other portable units (e.g. iOS) as well.

This list was made as a proof-of-concept, hence why it has so few filters (â‰¥23) at the time of writing (6th of Dec 2017). I am therefore very willing to listen to anyone who'd want to pick up on forking and maintaining this project on his/her/their own.
