# Title: ðŸ‘¸ Anti-FÑ–Ðœ list (Domains version)
# Version: 30July2020v3-Beta
# Expires: 5 days
# Description: Do you feel that Friendship is Magic overstayed its welcome? Here's a list that'll let you keep more of a distance to it.
# Motivation: You probably think that I'm one of those "Men shouldn't watch My Little Pony" fools? Nope, on the contrary. Being a fulltime viewer of actual preschool cartoons (read: Nella the Princess Knight, etc.), and have therefore seen just how staggeringly irrational that bronies can act towards them, I consider bronies to be fakers who preach hatred, destruction, and clan mentality, and I strongly regret that I was once one of them, many years ago.
# Note: I am on good terms with MLP G3 (the 2000's version), and this list will therefore usually not cover some shared terms between that version and FiM, such as 'Pinkie Pie' and 'Scootaloo'. Likewise, I am currently undecided on whether to target "Pony Life". If its jokes are sufficiently comical, and it pisses off bronies hard enough, I may possibly choose to _not_ write list entries against it.
# Note 2: Due to me (The list maintainer) running into mental health problems after looking through heaps of horrendous "artpieces", my lists can no longer deal with deviantART or Inkbunny.
