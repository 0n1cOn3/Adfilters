# adfilt

This is the place where I, Imre Kristoffer Eilertsen, host my web filter lists, for use in adblock tools and the likes. Github was by far the easiest way for laymen like me to store pure TXT files, which I thought was a necessity to share my filter lists across multiple units.

• ExperimentalNorwegianList.txt is a Norwegian-focused adblock list intended for public consumption. If you've been directed here by Adblock Plus or FilterLists, then this is the list you're using.

• a.txt is intended as an archive of my personal private filters, stored on Github in such a way that I can share them between my browsers and E-mail clients. It is NOT intended for public consumption, because it includes hundreds of filters that remove everything I don't like online, which includes filters that remove features that are liked by 95% of all other humans.

If you're a user of <i>Dandelion Sprouts norske filtre for ryddigere nettsider</i>, I request help in various ways to make the list better. After all, it has "Experimental" in its raw name, mostly because I forgot to rename it before I submitted it to various list subscription archives.
1) Are there any notable and somewhat-or-more active Norwegian websites that I've forgot to create filters for? Then tell me about them.
2) Since my list is tested on a 9:16 monitor, various filters with "nth-of-type" in their names need to be tested on wider monitors as well. If important boxes have disappeared on your end, tell me about them.
3) For that matter, if any of the filters remove things that really shouldn't be removed (Non-sponsored articles, entire pages, etc.), tell me about them. Bonus points if you know which filter entry it was that caused the problem.

In any of these cases, create an issue in the <i>Issues</i> tab above, at which I'll attempt to resolve the issue, and will afterwards close the issue. Closure does not prevent you from posting further replies in the issue thread, if you find more information about the situation afterwards.

I most dearly need some kind of feedback as to how many people that are using <i>Dandelion Sprouts norske filtre for ryddigere nettsider</i>. Therefore I request that active users of it should ★Star or ꙨWatch this repository, or to possibly find other non-obtrusive ways to show "I am using this list." to me in a way where I can see it. 

Jeg forsikrer dere også om at det såklart er fullt mulig å kontakte meg om adblock-listen på norsk bokmål, norsk nynorsk, dansk eller svensk, dersom dette er ønskelig for deg/dere.

—The tools that I use—

• Checker for redundant/duplicate filter entries, made by Famlam: https://arestwo.org/famlam/redundantRuleChecker.html

Ways one can use Sublime Text to improve his/her filter lists (https://www.sublimetext.com/):

• To sort filter entries in alphabetic order: F9 / Edit → Sort Lines

• To remove "www." from most entries: Ctrl+H / Find → Replace…

• To remove duplicates: Edit → Permute Lines → Unique

• To remove duplicates across files: Paste the content of the file that shall retain its filters on top, and paste the content of the file that shall delete its duplicates on bottom.
