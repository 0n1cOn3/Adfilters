! Title: ⚙️ Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List
! Version: 19February2021v1-Beta-Compilation
! Expires: 3 days
! Description: This list is made in the style of Fanboy's and AdGuard's annoyances lists, to show that I can make a just as good such annoyances list as them. It combines many of my proudest and most frequently maintained international lists, as a proof-of-concept and as a curated list for simplicity's sake.
! For more information and details about this list and other lists of mine, go to https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/General-info.md#english
