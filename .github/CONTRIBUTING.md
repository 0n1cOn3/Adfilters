Notes on how to contribute:

Issues and thoughts can be reported in the Issues tab. If you're reporting about a filter issue, you are expected to either explain the issue in deep detail, or to track down the problematic filter entry on your own. You're also encouraged to list:
* Which adblock lists are you using?
* Which adblock extension are you using?

Pull requests can be done, but they should permit me to be able to edit them, just in case there's some excusable formatting errors in your pull request.

Issues and problems will be tested for in the most recent stable version of Nano Adblocker, and on some occasions against those of uBlock Origin, Adblock Plus, AdGuard (chiefly the paid version), and AdBlock. For a list of supported, unsupported, and recommended adblockers, [read this](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/Supported%20adblockers%20and%20tools.md).

I do encourage forking, both for experimentation, archiving, or for any other reason you may come up with.

For the project's licence, I decided to modify BSD's three-point version in such a way that I did not claim copyright for the repo, since I don't like how copyrights work like in general. The licence is also intended to fully confirm the open-source status of the repo, if there are any doubts about it.

All communication and contribution that is permitted above, can also be done in Bokmål, Nynorsk, Swedish and Danish. In those cases, I would take contact with you in Bokmål, unless otherwise is requested.

Should I have missed out on any details that'd be nice to have in this contribution explanation, give me a heads up about it, e.g. in Issues.
