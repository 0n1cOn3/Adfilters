Notes on how to contribute:

• I don't currently intend to acquire extra project members, since this repo is a pretty personal thing for me, all in all.

• Issues and thoughts can be reported in the Issues tab. If you're reporting about a filter issue, you are expected to either explain the issue in deep detail, or to track down the problematic filter entry on your own. You're also encouraged to list:
* Which adblock lists are you using?
* Which adblock extension are you using?

• Pull requests can be done, but they should permit me to be able to edit them, just in case there's some excusable formatting errors in your pull request.

• I do encourage forking, both for experimentation, archiving, or for any other reason you may come up with.

• For the project's licence, I decided to modify BSD's three-point version in such a way that I did not claim copyright for the repo, since I don't like how copyrights work like in general. The licence is also intended to fully confirm the open-source status of the repo, if there are any doubts about it.

• All communication and contribution that is permitted above, can also be done in Bokmål, Nynorsk, Swedish and Danish. In those cases, I would take contact with you in Bokmål, unless otherwise is requested.

• Should I have missed out on any details that'd be nice to have in this contribution explanation, give me a heads up about it, e.g. in Issues.
