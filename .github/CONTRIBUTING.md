Notes on how to contribute:

Issues and thoughts can be reported in the Issues tab. If you're reporting about a filter issue, you are expected to either explain the issue in deep detail, or to track down the problematic filter entry on your own. You're also encouraged to list:
* Which adblock lists are you using?
* Which adblock extension are you using?

Pull requests can be done, but they should permit me to be able to edit them, just in case there's some excusable formatting errors in your pull request.

Issues and problems will be tested for in the most recent stable version of Nano Adblocker, and on some occasions against those of uBlock Origin, Adblock Plus, AdGuard (chiefly the paid version), and AdBlock. For a list of supported, unsupported, and recommended adblockers, [read this](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/Supported%20adblockers%20and%20tools.md).

If you're making a submission pull request to the Nordic list, make sure to do the edits to [the uBlock Origin version](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/NorwegianList.txt) (for the uBO, AdGuard, Adblock Plus, Privoxy, TPL, and uBO+privacy versions) and/or to [the domains version](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/NorwegianExperimentalList%20alternate%20versions/DandelionSproutsNorskeFiltreDomains.txt) (for all other versions). All other versions are generated from those two files.

I do encourage forking, both for experimentation, archiving, or for any other reason you may come up with.

All communication and contribution that is permitted above, can also be done in Bokmål, Nynorsk, Swedish and Danish. In those cases, I would take contact with you in Bokmål, unless otherwise is requested.

Should I have missed out on any details that'd be nice to have in this contribution explanation, give me a heads up about it, e.g. in Issues.
