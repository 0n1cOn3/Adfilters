This issue report form is intended for people who wish to contribute to help me write my lists beyond what I am able to do on my own, including people who have no real experience with GitHub.

## Tell me a tiny little bit about your tech experience
<!-- For example any previous experience with coding/adblockers, among other things you personally believe is relevant. Once you've written that, submit the "issue" and proceed to check off your desired buttons below. -->

## Testing and waterproofing lists (in / that are):

#### Please only select one of these tools if you are a frequent or regular user of them. For ABP/AdBlock, it's also necessary to know how to look into and resolve list problems.

- [ ] Adblock Plus or AdBlock
- [ ] Internet Explorer 11
- [ ] System-wide hosts file (Many possible interfaces and tools)
- [ ] Network-wide hosts file tools (Pi-hole, AdGuard Home, or Diversion)
- [ ] Android faux-VPN hosts file tools (Blokada or DNS66)
- [ ] Little Snitch
- [ ] uMatrix
- [ ] dnsmasq
- [ ] Privoxy
- [ ] Unbound
- [ ] ISC BIND 9
- [ ] Pfsense / PfBlockerNG

#### These can be selected regardless of your tools, as long as you can write entries for them and can see if they break anything of note.

- [ ] Marked in its version date as *Beta*
- [ ] Marked in its version date as *Alpha*

## Writing entries for:

- [ ] Internet Explorer 11
- [ ] Little Snitch
- [ ] FireHOL
- [ ] uMatrix (Rulesets)
- [ ] Danish and/or Icelandic fake webstore scams
- [ ] Danish geo-locked video sites (e.g. `tv3sport.dk`, among others)
- [ ] Norwegian and Danish far-right newssite-esque blogs

## Performing lobbyism in order for:

- [ ] Adblock Plus to [support wildcard asterisks in element rule domains](https://issues.adblockplus.org/ticket/6773)
- [ ] AdGuard to support wildcard asterisks in element rule domains
- [ ] *Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters* to be natively included in Adblock Plus (The process is already underway, but it's going very slowly)

## Translating section notes and text files to:

- [ ] Danish (incl. grammar-checking my 80% competent Danish writing skills)
- [ ] Icelandic
- [ ] Faroese
- [ ] Northern Sami

## Things that concern the adblock community at large

- [ ] Finding out who the current secretive owner of [uBlock LLC](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock/epcnnfbjfcgphgdmggkamkmgojdagdnn) and [a fake namesake of AdBlock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/dgpfeomibahlpbobpnjpcobpechebadh) is
- [ ] Lobbying for Chrome Extensions and/or Firefox Add-Ons to delist very-low-quality adblocker forks that don't have their disclaimers straight
- [ ] Figuring out how many of my and other listmakers' lists that can be accessed from internet-censoring trigger-happy countries (e.g. Saudi Arabia, Iran, PR-China)

## Other things:

- [ ] Setting up file combination scripts like what EasyList and Frellwit are using
- [ ] Create automatically generated MD5 hashes that are added to lists when they're edited
