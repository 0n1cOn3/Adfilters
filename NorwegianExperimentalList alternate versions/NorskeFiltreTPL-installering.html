Because Microsoft and GitHub (independently of one another) haven't exactly made it easy to add 3rd-party TPL lists, you'll have to do the following steps.<br><br>

1) Save this file as an HTML file. (This can be done by e.g. right-clicking on the raw file and saving, or by pasting it into a notepad and saving it there.)<br>
2) Open the saved HTML file in Internet Explorer.<br>
3) If you've done #1 and #2 correctly, click on the link to the right to install <a href="javascript:window.external.msAddTrackingProtectionList('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/NorwegianExperimentalList%20alternate%20versions/DandelionSproutsNorskeFiltre.tpl', 'Dandelion Sprouts norske filtre - IE-versjonen')">the TPL version of Dandelion Sprout's Norwegian Filters</a>.<br>
3.5) Normally the link will be blocked the first time around. If so, click on "[Tillat blokkert innhold / Allow Blocked Content]" below, and then click the link above again.<br>
4) Just in case you haven't done so already, make sure to also subscribe to the official TPL versions of <a href="javascript:window.external.msAddTrackingProtectionList('https://easylist-msie.adblockplus.org/easylist.tpl','EasyList TPL')">EasyList</a>.<br><br>

Language note: Since Internet Explorer's HTML reader doesn't support Unicode (for whatever reason), I had to write this procedure in English instead of Norwegian. Sorry about that.
