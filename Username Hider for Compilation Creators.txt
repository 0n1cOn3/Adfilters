! Are you tired of having to use Paint to remove potentially sensitive usernames, each and every time you're making a compilation of social media posts? Say no more! This list will remove posters' usernames from the biggest compilation sources, so that you can simply take a screencap and add it directly into your video/timeline!
! If you decide to go full weirdo, you could also use this list to turn normal websites into anonymous-esque environments. But since I'm hostile to imageboards, don't expect me to condone such an act.
! The level of work I place into this list, is roughly proportional to how many people that tell me that they use it. Take the survey at https://dandelionsprout.polldaddy.com/s/adfilt-brukerunders%C3%B8kelse, and/or tell me about sites you want me to add filters for at https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/issues.
