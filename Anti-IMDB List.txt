! Title: Anti-IMDB List
! Version: 04August2018v2-Beta
! Description: Are you tired of being told by others what you should watch, specifically the hipsters that run around on IMDB? Here's a way to let you feel more peaceful with your truly own opinions.
! Note that this list does currently not aim to remove the sites' own rating mechanics.
! Note that this list aims solely to support advanced adblockers (e.g. not Adblock Plus), to avoid the inconvenience of having to list 15 Amazon domains for each Amazon-related entry.
! For more information and details about this list and other lists of mine, go to https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/General-info.md#english

! Multi-domain entries
