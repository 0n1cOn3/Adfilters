! Title: 🐂 Dandelion Sprout's List for the Benefit of r/assholedesign
! Version: 28February2019v1-Beta-Compilation
! Expires: 2 days
! Description: This compilation list was made to help resolve two of the most frequent tech complaints on r/assholedesign: Websites that require logging in to browse them, and Android apps with fake notification counters. To that effect, this list embeds two of my other lists that covers either one of those purposes. This list requires using Nano Adblocker or uBlock Origin, the latter of which is also available for Firefox on Android phones, as they're the only adblockers that have full support for list embeddings. Now let's see how many months it'll take before anyone on that subreddit notices the existence of this list...

! How to remove annoying things that this list doesn't cover:
! To remove obstructing general ads on phones, I recommend using Firefox for Android with the uBlock Origin extension, with various ad-related lists turned on (e.g. EasyList, AdGuard Base, AdGuard Mobile). This list will therefore not take care of such ads, as it'd be superfluous to do so.
! To remove requests to turn off adblockers on both desktops and phones, download Nano or uBO, and also use such lists as e.g. Adblock Warning Removal List, uBlock Filters, and/or Nano Defender Integration.
! To uninstall apps that are included in Windows 10, use Geekuninstaller at https://geekuninstaller.com/
! To remove cookie notifications, I personally recommend https://www.i-dont-care-about-cookies.eu/

! Emergency fix for cookie notifications in Imgur embeds on Reddit, as it hasn't been fixed in any cookie lists that I know of.
