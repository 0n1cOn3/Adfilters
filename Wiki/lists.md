## About the lists in this repo
| List name | Link | Description | Other versions | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Dandelion Sprout's Nordic filters for tidier websites | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/NorwegianList.txt) | This list covers websites for Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Danish territories, Schleswig-Holstein's Danish minority, and the Sami indigenous population | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/tree/master/NorwegianExperimentalList%20alternate%20versions) | My adblocking filter for norwegians, which is included in uBlock Origin and AdGuard
| Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/AnnoyancesList) | This list is made in the style of Fanboy's and AdGuard's annoyances lists, to show that I can make a just as good such annoyances list as them. It combines many of my proudest and most frequently maintained international lists, as a proof-of-concept and as a curated list for simplicity's sake. | N/A | It is recommended you look over what is included in this list before installing this |
| Ad Removal List for Unusual Ads | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/AdRemovalListForUnusualAds.txt) | This is a list to remove the kinds of ads that very few well-established international adblocker lists would want to remove, due to many of them not meeting those lists' strict criteria of what an ad actually is. So that's where this list comes into play. | N/A | None |
| Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Dandelion%20Sprout's%20Anti-Malware%20List.txt) | This list goes the extra kilometer to prevent more malware than other mainstream anti-malware lists. It blocks heavily abused top-level domains (and even search engine results for them), blocks domains used in malware redirection trains and in domain parking schemes, blocks sponsored Windows PUP nags on PC guide articles, uses mass blocking of domains belonging to bad IPs, and has many other subcategories that give it a solid advantage over similar lists out there. | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/tree/master/Alternate%20versions%20Anti-Malware%20List) | None |
| Actually Legitimate URL Shortener Tool | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt) | In a world dominated by bit.ly, adf.ly, and several thousand other malware cover-up tools, this list reduces the length of URLs in a much more legitimate and transparent manner. Essentially, it automatically removes unnecessary $/& values from the URLs, making them easier to copy from the URL bar and pasting elsewhere as links. Enjoy. | N/A | This list is included in my annoyances list, so there isn't a reason to install both |
| Browse websites without logging in | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/BrowseWebsitesWithoutLoggingIn.txt) | Are you tired of being nagged on by websites, that say "Log in to read more"? With this list, you'll be much less nagged on from now own. | [AdGuard](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Other%20domains%20versions/BrowseWebsitesWithoutLoggingInAGH.txt) and [Domains](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Other%20domains%20versions/BrowseWebsitesWithoutLoggingInDomains.txt) | None |
