## About the lists in this repo
| List name | Link | Mirror | Description | Other versions | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Dandelion Sprout's Nordic filters for tidier websites | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/NorwegianList.txt) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/NorwegianList.txt) | This list covers websites for Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Danish territories, Schleswig-Holstein's Danish minority, and the Sami indigenous population | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/tree/master/NorwegianExperimentalList%20alternate%20versions) | My adblocking filter for norwegians, which is included in uBlock Origin and AdGuard
| Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/AnnoyancesList) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/AnnoyancesList) | This list is made in the style of Fanboy's and AdGuard's annoyances lists, to show that I can make a just as good such annoyances list as them. It combines many of my proudest and most frequently maintained international lists, as a proof-of-concept and as a curated list for simplicity's sake. | N/A | It is recommended you look over what is included in this list before installing this |
| Ad Removal List for Unusual Ads | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/AdRemovalListForUnusualAds.txt) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/AdRemovalListForUnusualAds.txt) | This is a list to remove the kinds of ads that very few well-established international adblocker lists would want to remove, due to many of them not meeting those lists' strict criteria of what an ad actually is. So that's where this list comes into play. | N/A | None |
| Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Dandelion%20Sprout's%20Anti-Malware%20List.txt) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/Dandelion%20Sprout's%20Anti-Malware%20List.txt) | This list goes the extra kilometer to prevent more malware than other mainstream anti-malware lists. It blocks heavily abused top-level domains (and even search engine results for them), blocks domains used in malware redirection trains and in domain parking schemes, blocks sponsored Windows PUP nags on PC guide articles, uses mass blocking of domains belonging to bad IPs, and has many other subcategories that give it a solid advantage over similar lists out there. | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/tree/master/Alternate%20versions%20Anti-Malware%20List) | None |
| Actually Legitimate URL Shortener Tool | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt) | In a world dominated by bit.ly, adf.ly, and several thousand other malware cover-up tools, this list reduces the length of URLs in a much more legitimate and transparent manner. Essentially, it automatically removes unnecessary $/& values from the URLs, making them easier to copy from the URL bar and pasting elsewhere as links. Enjoy. | N/A | This list is included in my annoyances list, so there isn't a reason to install both |
| Browse websites without logging in | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/BrowseWebsitesWithoutLoggingIn.txt) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/BrowseWebsitesWithoutLoggingIn.txt) | Are you tired of being nagged on by websites, that say "Log in to read more"? With this list, you'll be much less nagged on from now own. | [AdGuard](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Other%20domains%20versions/BrowseWebsitesWithoutLoggingInAGH.txt) and [Domains](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Other%20domains%20versions/BrowseWebsitesWithoutLoggingInDomains.txt) | None |
| Anti-'Christmas carols' List | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Anti-'Christmas%20carols'%20List.txt) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/Anti-'Christmas%20carols'%20List.txt) | Do you use music streaming services, and have grown really tired of how the same few songs are covered every year by every band and artist that have ever existed (and some that haven't)? Now you can let your eyes get a break from coming across just those songs. | N/A | This list very likely doesn't edit the play queue itself, so some caution should be taken when browsing through winter albums and playlists nevertheless. |
| Anti-'Custom cursors' List | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Anti-'Custom%20cursors'%20List.txt) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/Anti-'Custom%20cursors'%20List.txt) | This list aims to replace websites' custom cursors with the default OS cursor. | N/A | Any Wikia-related entries currently do not work in ABP or AdBlock, due to EasyList having a whitelisting for the nocookie.net domain that can only be circumvented with "$badfilter" or "$important", neither of which are supported by those two extensions.
| Anti-'Google Hangouts' List | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Anti-'Google%20Hangouts'%20List.txt) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/Anti-'Google%20Hangouts'%20List.txt) | Are you a non-user of Hangouts, and are tired of seeing the uncloseable Hangouts section on Gmail, and various Hangouts buttons and pages? Then this is the list for you. | N/A | None |
| Anti-Elsagate List | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Anti-Elsagate%20List.txt) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/Anti-Elsagate%20List.txt) | This list aims to remove particularly disturbing content on YouTube, Vimeo, DailyMotion, Internet Archive, and Rumble that targets young children, as well as nursery rhymes, "Finger Family", "Wrong Heads", and other things that are hotbeds for extremely unproductive videos. Also supports YouTube on mobile browsers (but sadly not the apps). | N/A | In order to be really certain of avoiding Elsagate, especially in the case of children, this list also deactivates Autoplay and end-of-video links, but at the moment only on desktop browsers. |
| Anti-Futa List | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Anti-Futa%20List.txt) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/Anti-Futa%20List.txt) | It seems to me that a common thought process on porn sites are "Hey, do you know what would've made this cute woman even sexier? I know. We should give her a dick!". Well, not anymore, thanks to this list. | N/A | Due to me (The list maintainer) running into mental health problems after looking through heaps of horrendous "artpieces", my lists can no longer deal with deviantART. |
| Anti-FіМ list | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Anti-FіМ%20List.txt) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/Anti-FіМ%20List.txt) | Do you feel that Friendship is Magic overstayed its welcome? Here's a list that'll let you keep more of a distance to it. | N/A | I am on good terms with MLP G3 (the 2000's version), and this list will therefore usually not cover some shared terms between that version and FiM, such as 'Pinkie Pie' and 'Scootaloo'. Likewise, I am currently undecided on whether to target "Pony Life". If its jokes are sufficiently comical, and it pisses off bronies hard enough, I may possibly choose to _not_ write list entries against it. Due to me (The list maintainer) running into mental health problems after looking through heaps of horrendous "artpieces", my lists can no longer deal with deviantART. |
| Japanese Text Softener | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/JapaneseTextSoftener.txt) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/JapaneseTextSoftener.txt) | The font situation on many Japanese websites is kind-of absolutely atrocious on Windows (Other OSs are much less affected). They use super-stiff janky fonts resemblant of Windows 95 or Amiga. And even worse, many of the sites also default to the stiff Japanese fonts' atrocious Latin letter types. Here's how to use the sites in a way that is compatible with the 3rd decade of the 21st century. | N/A | None |
| Dandelion Sprout's Lightweight Anti-'Social share' List | [Link](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/SocialShareList.txt) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/-/raw/master/SocialShareList.txt) | This list aims to achieve pretty broad (if not overly broad) coverage of social sharing buttons, with perhaps 1/50th~1/100th as many entries as what the biggest anti-'social button' lists out there have. | N/A | None |
