# How to support websites

If you are among those who feel guilt over lowering the incomes of Norwegian websites, while still feeling that you are in a need to remove (b)ads from them, here are some other ways to support them.

• Most of the significant newssites: Subscribe to their subscription services.<br>
• Pretty much every site: Subscribe to their often-promoted newsletters. I wouldn't have wanted to subscribe to too many of them (Especially not on your primary E-mail address), but surely there must be a reason why they want you to subscribe to them. A few of them also still have RSS newsfeeds, for users of desktop E-mail clients and of dedicated RSS tools.<br>
• TV2 and VG: Subscribe to their TV channels, or pick them as your choice channels on cable TV or on RiksTV Favoritter.<br>
• Aftenposten: Make use of the A-kortet for various supported offers.<br>
• ITavisen: Subscribe to their €5/month [maintenance subscription](https://pay.getadmiral.com/subscribe/A-59ABD79791C01F574B49DA46-1).<br>
• Norsk Tipping: If you do want to bet in football pools and lotteries, there's nothing stopping you from doing that. After all, if you're already keen on gambling, a few adticles here and there can't make that much of a difference anyway.<br>
• Sites that offer direct donations that I know of: [Steigan](https://betaling.steigan.no/), [NewsInEnglish.no](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=RCQise0ARkqp845RCRAyst0e-BwGTaGFpU4fpTJxiRNEEEucDSBpGvoHVh-DgCCNN8vQu0&country.x=US&locale.x=US)<br>
• Sites that support Flattr: [Saksynt](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?uid=civix&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftjomlid.com%2F2015%2F11%2F15%2Fkortpost-vi-er-alle-mordere%2F)
