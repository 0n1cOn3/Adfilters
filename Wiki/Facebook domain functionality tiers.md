#### Test environment(s)

* Last tested on the 25th of February 2020 from Trondheim, Norway.
* The default browser locale was set to Norwegian Bokm√•l.
* Facebook domains were tested in Chrome on Windows 10 Pro. Facebookcorewwwi domains were tested in Tor Browser for Windows.
* No proxies were used.
* No user-agent changes were made to the browsers (which may explain some strange outcomes regarding phone-specific domains between Facebook and Facebookcorewwwi; and between Chromium and Gecko browsers).
