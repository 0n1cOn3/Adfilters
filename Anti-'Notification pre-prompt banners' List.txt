! Title: ðŸ”‡ Anti-'Notification pre-prompt banners' List
! Version: 15March2019v1-Alpha
! Expires: 6 days
! Description: PC browser notifications have become something of a wild west. Not only are they being used by many websites as a shoddy newsletter substitute, but some are even showing you large banner prompts that ask if you want to see the actual notification prompts. This list blocks such banners.
