! Title: Dandelion Sprout's Disallowed Clients for AdGuard Home in Particular
! Version: 01December2019v1-Beta
! Expires: 7 days
! Description: This is a list of unusually strange and/or presumed hostile IP addresses that thought it'd be a good idea to port scan or otherwise mistreat my publicly accessible AdGuard Home server, without having anything even close to a good reason for doing so.
! Rule of thumbs for list inclusion: If the IP is PR-Chinese, VPN-related, or from a nondescript hosting server (e.g. Amazon AWS), it goes on my list. If it's Arbor Observatory, Shodan, or guys who have 'research' in their domain names, they're fine with me. I can't easily pin any bad activities on Hurricane Electric, so they're fine with me until further notice.
