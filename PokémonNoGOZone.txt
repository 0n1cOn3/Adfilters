! Title: ðŸ›€ PokÃ©mon No-GO Zone
! Version: 30June2020v1-Alpha
! Description: Are you desperate to get some quality time with your brother or dad, who is so much into PokÃ©mon GO that they play it to this day while hacking around from the couch? Here's how to get that quality time backâ€¦ unless they just change their connection to 4G instead, in which case you're screwed. May also work against 'Harry Potter: Wizards Unite' and 'Ingress Prime'.
! Note: The list currently only supports AdGuard Home, AdGuard for Android, AdGuard for iOS, and presumably Pi-Hole (RegEx versions only). There is no reason whatsoever to use this list on a desktop PC, so I've intentionally made this list not work in any uBlock Origin- or Adblock Plus-based adblockers, nor in PC or browser versions of AdGuard.
